## Objective(s):

This activity aims to apply all the learnings for the Final Period.

## Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs):

- Demonstrate how to train and save a model.
- Demonstrate how to deploy the deep learning model in the cloud. (not Machine Learning model)

## Deep-Learning Model

This web app is a deployment of a Plant Disease Detection Deep Learning Model. The model can detect plant leaf disease of 3 plants: Cotton, Tomato, and Potato.

To use the app:

1. Select the appropriate plant to detect.
